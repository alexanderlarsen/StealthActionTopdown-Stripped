# Top-down Stealth Action Shooter - Stripped down Unity project
**Disclaimer: The GitHub repository you are viewing is a simplified version of a larger personal game project. It was created for the sole purpose of portfolio demonstration. To ensure there are no licensing or legal complications, I've cloned my original project and omitted all third-party assets. Consequently, this version of the project does not compile and lacks numerous assets. Therefore, it should be considered solely for inspection and review purposes.**

During a two-month development of this top-down stealth action shooter game, my aim was creating a vertical slice that both draws inspiration from and expands upon the gameplay of Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions (1999). All code in the Assets/Scripts folder of this repo has been written by me.
