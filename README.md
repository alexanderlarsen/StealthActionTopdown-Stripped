# Top-down Stealth Action Shooter - Stripped down Unity project
This Github repo is a stripped down version of a bigger personal game project. For portfolio demonstration purposes, I removed all third party assets from my real, private repo in this public repo to avoid license issues. 

During a two-month development of this top-down stealth action shooter game, my aim was creating a vertical slice that both draws inspiration from and expands upon the gameplay of Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions (1999). All code in the Assets/Scripts folder of this repo has been written by me.
